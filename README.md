# Piwik TopPagesByActions Plugin

## Description

This is a plugin for the Open Source Web Analytics platform Piwik. If enabled, it will add a new widget that you can add to your dashboard.

The widget will show the top performing pages of a site that auto-refreshes every x seconds. It shows the number of actions and the title of the page. It is auto-sorting the entries.

**This plugin should run fine with installations with up to 100.000 page impressions per day. If you run a very large piwik installation and have performance issues with this plugin, please contact me - there is a solution for this. I have it up and running in an installation with more than 10 million visits per day.**

(Tested with piwik 2.8.3, but supposed to run with older versions)
